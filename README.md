## Sessions  

**VW14 - Get Func-y: Delegates in C#**  
*Level: Introductory / Intermediate*  

Delegates are the gateway to functional programming. So lets understand delegates and how we can change the way we program by using functions as parameters, variables, and properties. In addition, we'll see how the built in delegate types, Func and Action, are waiting to make our lives easier. We'll see how delegates can add elegance, extensibility, and safety to our programming.

You will learn:
* What delegates are  
* How to use functions as parameters and return values  
* Write code that can be easily extended

**VH06 - I'll Get Back to You: Task, Await, and Asynchronous Methods in C#**  

*Level: Introductory / Intermediate*  

There's a lot of confusion about async/await, Task/TPL, and asynchronous and parallel programming in general. So let's start with the basics and look at how we can call asynchronous methods using Task and then see how the "await" operator can makes things easier for us. Along the way, we'll look at continuations, ConfigureAwait, and exception handling.

You will learn:  
* How to run code after a Task is complete  
* How to handle exceptions that occur in an asynchronous method  
* When to use "ConfigureAwait"
